			<h2>Reasons to connect</h2>
			<p>
				Spending time in green space or bringing nature into your everyday life can benefit both your mental and physical wellbeing. For example, doing things like growing food or flowers, exercising outdoors or being around animals can have lots of positive effects.

			<h2>Ways to get in touch with nature</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Look up</h2>
					<p>Stars are a good reminder of our place within the universe, and contemplating how small we are in the grand scheme of things can be humbling and put things into perspective. Suddenly the trivial “problems” we have don’t seem so problematic.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Look down</h2>
					<p>I once read that if all the insects on Earth suddenly disappeared, within 50 years all life would become extinct; and that if all humans suddenly disappeared, all life would flourish. This really drives home the importance of these little creatures crawling around on the ground and buzzing around our ears. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Go out in the rain without an umbrella</h2>
					<p>The practice of letting go and allowing nature to take its course without my intervention was metaphorical for me that day. It taught me a valuable life lesson about the illusion of control.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Do a bit of gardening</h2>
					<p>Tending to the plants and watching them grow on a regular basis brings a whole new level of appreciation for where our food comes from and puts us more in touch with the natural cycle of birth, life, and death.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Get away from your screen and go for a walk</h2>
					<p>If you’re sitting in front of a screen, it means you aren’t in touch with nature. Switch it off and go find some green space.</p>
				</li>
